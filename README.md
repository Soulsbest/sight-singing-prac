# Sight Singing Prac (https://soulsbest.github.io/sight-singing-prac/)
This is a very random website that I wanted to use to practice my sight singing for AP Music Theory


# Q&A
### Is it very useful?
    No, it just does the one thing and I'm probably the only one who even wants that thing

### Isn't this design hugely derivate of the morse train?
    Yes, I made this while I was working on it okay ):

### Does the text scale for different screen sizes
    Not in the slightest. The values are hard-coded for my particularly large monitor. 
    If there is a human being alive interested in this project that can be fixed

### Will anyone read to the end of this Q&A?
    Before you read this, my answer was a quantum state of both yes and no influenced 
    by the state of all particles everywhere. Now the answer is a clear yes.
